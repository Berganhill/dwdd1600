        <h2>How It started</h2>
        <p> The owner of Wand, Brooks Young, has been skating since he was 13 years old. He noticed as he became an adult how much money and how frequently he is spending money on new skateboards. With this, he decided to get bulk plain skateboards so that it would not be as expensive. He got a ton of attention from his friends and was able to sell the boards for just a couple dollars more. Once he could make money off of each board, he decided to start his own company selling boards and decided to name it <strong> Wand </strong>.<br>
                                     
        Wand started at <address> 1295 Hunter Hollow Draper Utah</address> </p>
